# Internship at PrometheusAI IPL Data

In this project, I worked on the IPL Dataset obtained form Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020) and Scraped bowlers data from (http://www.howstat.com).

The main objective of the project is to predict the number of runs a batsmen can score in an over. 

#### Project Tasks:

Data Cleaning

EDA

Data PreProcessing

Model Building

Model Evaluation


#### EDA and Model Objectives:

Does bowling combinations lead to get more wickets in a match?

Where do all the 6s or 4s happen? Is it at the start of an over, the middle, or the end?

Where do all of the outs happen? Is it at the start of an over, the middle, or the end?

How did the Batsmen and the Bowlers perform within a match,within a season and in their overall careers.

Given a Batsmen what are the total runs that a Batsmen can score in an over of a match.
