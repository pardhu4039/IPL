# Internship at PrometheusAI IPL Data

In this project, I worked on the IPL Dataset obtained form Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020) and Scraped bowlers data from (http://www.howstat.com).

The main objective of the project is to predict the number of runs a batsmen can score in an over. 

#### Project Tasks:

Data Cleaning

EDA

Data PreProcessing

Model Building

Model Evaluation


#### EDA:

Does bowling combinations lead to get more wickets in a match?

Where do all the 6s or 4s happen? Is it at the start of an over, the middle, or the end?

Where do all of the outs happen? Is it at the start of an over, the middle, or the end?

How did the Batsmen and the Bowlers perform within a match,within a season and in their overall careers.

#### Model Objective:
Given a Batsmen what are the total runs that a Batsmen can score in an over of a match against a Bowler.

Given a Batsmen and an over in a match ( for example: the batsmen faces a bowler_type of fast) would the predicting outcome or the number of runs a batsmen can score if he had faced medium or spin bowlers is changed and if the number of runs change then how would it have effected the outcome of the match.
